This code repository offers a comprehensive analysis of monthly trends in furniture sales, employing time series decomposition techniques to discern underlying components such as trend, seasonality, and residual variations. This analytical framework is instrumental for gaining insights into patterns, facilitating accurate forecasts, and pinpointing factors influencing furniture sales.

Additionally, the repository includes an implementation of the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The process commences with the loading and preprocessing of furniture sales data, followed by the visualization of monthly sales trends. Subsequent steps involve partitioning the data into training and testing sets, specifying the ARIMA order (p, d, q), and leveraging the ARIMA model to predict future sales. The model's efficacy is assessed using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and the comparison between actual and predicted sales values is presented in a visual plot, enabling a nuanced evaluation of forecasting accuracy.
